# What this is.

This is just a collection of my first random experiments with Reflex. 

Like many things; the Haskell reflex/ghcjs ecosystem is surprisingly vast and complete; and it can be intimidating for newcomers to start with it.
I happened to receive help from [@srid](https://github.com/srid) who wrote the wonderful to get started with [Reflex stone](https://github.com/srid/reflex-stone) which helped me get started. 

I'd suggest starting out there. 

But please feel free to see my solutions to some exercises here if you wish. I'd be very interested in hearing feedback of what can be improved.
